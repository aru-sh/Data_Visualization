# Data_Visualization
->The project consists of analysis of near 1 million Indian news headlines which were published from 2001-2017 end. I used R, Python, Excel for dataset handling and Used Tableau and Excel for data visualizations.<br> 
->The dataset was available on Kaggle. 
->I used NLTK Natural Language Processing Library in Python to do sentimental analysis of headlines, giving a compound value to each headline which ranged from -1 to +1, -1 being extremely negative news and +1 being extremely positive news. 
->I then selected controversial keywords in headlines like Terrorism, Rape, Murder, Pakistan and popular topics like Modi, Dhoni, Kohli. 
->I then selected all the headlines bearing these keywords and analyzed the sentiment. 
->The results were visualized leading to many interesting inferences.
