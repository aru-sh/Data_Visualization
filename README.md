# Data_Visualization
The project consists of analysis of near 7 Lakh Indian news headlines which were published from 2001-2017 end. We used R, Python, Excel for dataset handling and Used Tableau and Excel for data visualizations. The dataset was available on Kaggle. We used NLTK Natural Language Processing Library in Python to do sentimental analysis of headlines, giving a compound value to each headline which ranged from -1 to +1, -1 being extremely negative news and +1 being extremely positive news. We then selected controversial keywords in headlines like Terrorism, Rape, Murder, Pakistan and popular topics like Modi, Dhoni, Kohli. We then selected all the headlines bearing these keywords and analyzed the sentiment. We then visualized the results and were able to find interesting inferences.
